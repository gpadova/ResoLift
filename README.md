## Local-First Architecture

ResoLift uses a robust local-first architecture for optimal performance and offline capabilities:

### Data Storage

- **SQLite**: Primary database using DrizzleORM with SQLCipher encryption
- **MMKV**: High-performance key-value storage for app state and user preferences
- **File System**: Local storage for assets and cached data

### Key Components

- DrizzleORM migrations for database schema versioning
- Automatic data synchronization with SQLite
- Type-safe database queries with TypeScript
- Encrypted storage on iOS using SQLCipher

### Data Flow

1. Local data mutations through DrizzleORM
2. Real-time UI updates via useLiveQuery
3. Automatic persistence to SQLite
4. Background sync capabilities (coming soon)
